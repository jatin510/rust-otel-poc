# Rust OpenTelemetry with Jaeger Setup Checklist

## Project Setup
- [x] Initialize a new Rust project with cargo
- [x] Configure Cargo.toml with required dependencies
- [x] Create a basic project structure with appropriate modules

## Dependencies
- [x] opentelemetry - Core OpenTelemetry implementation
- [x] opentelemetry-jaeger - Jaeger exporter for OpenTelemetry
- [x] tracing - Application-level tracing
- [x] tracing-opentelemetry - Bridge between tracing and OpenTelemetry
- [x] tracing-subscriber - For collecting and processing trace data
- [x] serde, serde_json - For JSON serialization/deserialization
- [x] actix-web or warp - Web framework for the API endpoints
- [x] tokio - Async runtime

## Jaeger Setup
- [x] Install Jaeger locally (Docker recommended)
- [x] Configure Jaeger agent settings in the application
- [x] Set up appropriate sampling configuration

## API Implementation
- [x] Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- [x] GET endpoint for user information retrieval
- [x] POST endpoint for user data submission
- [x] JSON schema design for user data

## OpenTelemetry Integration
- [x] Initialize OpenTelemetry with Jaeger exporter
- [x] Configure trace context propagation
- [x] Set up middleware for HTTP request tracing
- [x] Add custom spans for business logic
- [x] Implement error tracking with appropriate span events

## Data Storage
- [x] Create JSON file structure for user data storage
- [x] Implement read/write operations with proper error handling
- [x] Add tracing to data operations

## Testing
- [x] Unit tests for core functionality
- [x] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [x] Verify trace data is correctly sent to Jaeger

## Deployment Considerations
- [x] Environment configuration for different deployment scenarios
- [x] Docker setup for application
- [x] Docker Compose configuration for application + Jaeger

## Documentation
- [x] API documentation
- [x] Setup instructions
- [x] OpenTelemetry configuration details
