# Rust OpenTelemetry with Jaeger Setup Checklist

## Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize a new Rust project with cargo
- [ ] Configure Cargo.toml with required dependencies
- [ ] Create a basic project structure with appropriate modules

## Dependencies
- [ ] opentelemetry - Core OpenTelemetry implementation
- [ ] opentelemetry-jaeger - Jaeger exporter for OpenTelemetry
- [ ] tracing - Application-level tracing
- [ ] tracing-opentelemetry - Bridge between tracing and OpenTelemetry
- [ ] tracing-subscriber - For collecting and processing trace data
- [ ] serde, serde_json - For JSON serialization/deserialization
- [ ] actix-web or warp - Web framework for the API endpoints
- [ ] tokio - Async runtime

## Jaeger Setup
- [ ] Install Jaeger locally (Docker recommended)
- [ ] Configure Jaeger agent settings in the application
- [ ] Set up appropriate sampling configuration

## API Implementation
- [ ] Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- [ ] GET endpoint for user information retrieval
- [ ] POST endpoint for user data submission
- [ ] JSON schema design for user data

## OpenTelemetry Integration
- [ ] Initialize OpenTelemetry with Jaeger exporter
- [ ] Configure trace context propagation
- [ ] Set up middleware for HTTP request tracing
- [ ] Add custom spans for business logic
- [ ] Implement error tracking with appropriate span events

## Data Storage
- [ ] Create JSON file structure for user data storage
- [ ] Implement read/write operations with proper error handling
- [ ] Add tracing to data operations

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Verify trace data is correctly sent to Jaeger

## Deployment Considerations
- [ ] Environment configuration for different deployment scenarios
- [ ] Docker setup for application
- [ ] Docker Compose configuration for application + Jaeger

## Documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Setup instructions
- [ ] OpenTelemetry configuration details
